If you're ready to contribute code, that's fantastic! Here‚Äôs how to get started.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

To get your local development environment up and running, follow these steps:

1.  **Prerequisites**:
    * Go (version 1.18 or later is recommended)
    * Git

2.  **Fork and Clone the Repository**:
    * Fork the repository on GitHub.
    * Clone your fork locally:
        ```bash
        git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/wazctl.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/wazctl.git)
        cd wazctl
        ```

3.  **Build the Project**:
    You can build the `wazctl` binary using the standard Go command:
    ```bash
    go build .
    ```
    This will create a `wazctl` executable in the root directory. You can run it with `./wazctl`.

4.  **Run Tests**:
    Before making any changes, make sure the existing tests pass:
    ```bash
    go test ./...
    ```

## ‚úÖ Pull Request Process

1.  **Create a new branch** for your feature or bugfix. Please use a descriptive branch name (e.g., `feature/add-agent-restart` or `fix/config-parsing-error`).
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/my-amazing-feature
    ```

2.  **Make your changes**. Write clean, readable code and add comments where necessary.

3.  **Add or update tests**. If you're adding a new feature, please include tests for it. If you're fixing a bug, add a test that catches the bug to prevent regressions.

4.  **Ensure all tests pass**:
    ```bash
    go test ./...
    ```

5.  **Format your code**:
    Make sure your Go code is formatted correctly using `gofmt`.
    ```bash
    gofmt -w .
    ```

6.  **Commit your changes**. Use a clear and descriptive commit message. We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification. For example:
    * `feat: add restart functionality for agents`
    * `fix: resolve panic when config file is empty`
    * `docs: update agent management section in README`

7.  **Push your branch** to your fork on GitHub:
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/my-amazing-feature
    ```

8.  **Open a Pull Request** to the `main` branch of the original `wazctl`
    repository. Provide a clear title and a detailed description of your
changes. Link to any relevant issues.

Thank you again for your contribution!
